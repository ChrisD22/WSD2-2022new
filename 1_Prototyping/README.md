# Design and Prototyping

## Submission Point Four

SP4 is a collection of documents resulting from the web development processes undertaken during week 4. 

Formative feedback on these documents will be provided during your weekly meeting with the tutors, enabling you to make amendments before final submission.

The following document should be presented:

- [Page Design](#page-design)

## Page design

### What is this?

This technique involves creating a final page design after each team member has tried creating an initial design for your group’s web site. Each person works independently, and when finished, shares his/her concepts with the team. The team then considers each solution, and each member uses the best ideas to further improve their own solution.

> &ldquo;This process helps to generate many different, diverse ideas and ensures that the best ideas from each design are integrated into the final site design. What is most striking about parallel design is how many ideas can be considered in a very short time period.&rdquo; [Usability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/parallel-design.html)

### To start the process

- Each team member must work independently on his/her own design concept for your website.

- Your design may address issues such as layout, space, form, colour, typography whilst always considering usability and accessibility.

- Consider your design from a ‘mobile first’ perspective.

- All of your design concepts should be created initially as low-fi wireframes on paper. **Pencil &amp; paper first!**

> Get your ideas down on paper, iterate and refine later.

- Your design concept can be further developed as hi-fi or low-fi using the various techniques explained in class.

- These techniques include a composition (comp) created in Photoshop, a low-fi HTML/CSS wireframe (perhaps using a grid system) or a mock-up using [Axure](https://www.axure.com/edu), [AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html), [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/education-signup), [Marvel](https://marvelapp.com), [Figma](https://www.figma.com) or [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

> You can use [dummy text and images](https://contentsnare.com/dummy-text-image-generators/) as placeholders.

**Tip:** _Be creative, but keep it realistic. After all, you’ve got to build this at some point. It also has to be both accessible and useable_.

### Parallel design process

1. Once everyone has completed their initial designs the team should get together and share their design concepts and other ideas.

> Following this meeting each member should review his/her own design to make amendments and improvements.

2. The team should then meet for a final time to agree which elements from the individual designs will be used to create the team's _final design_.

> Note - these meetings can be virtual. For example you could post images of your work on GitHub and discuss on the project Kanban board.

3. The last task for the team is to create a _final design_ (mobile and desktop). This is the design you intend to take forward into the build process, and which will be tested in SP4.


### Page Design Report

Each group member will add their design plus the group's _final design_ to the file:
